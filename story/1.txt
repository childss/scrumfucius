Congrats! You were the quickest to learn the first lesson! 
A good team needs to be both collaborative and communicative. 
Nobody neither carried out his task, nor communicated with the team members about the task.
As Nobody, you would have *assumed* that other team members would do all the work. 
And you know what happens when you *assume* things?

Think about what would be a better choice, and in our next installment, we'll see how you'd fare as Anybody, Everybody, or Somebody!

THANKS FOR PLAYING :)
