Congrats! You were the quickest to learn the first lesson! 
A good team needs to be both collaborative and communicative. 
Nobody neither carried out his task, nor communicated with 
the team members about the task.
As Nobody, you would have *assumed* that other team members
 would do all the work. 
And you know what happens when you *assume* things?

Think about what would've been a better option, and 
learn more about Somebody, Anybody, and Everybody 
in our next installment!

THANKS FOR PLAYING! :)
