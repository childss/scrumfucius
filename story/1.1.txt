Congrats! You were the quickest to learn the first lesson! You win the trophy for the Quickest Learner of the Agile Follies!

A good team needs to be both collaborative and communicative. 
Nobody neither carried out his task, nor communicated with the team members about the task.
As Nobody, you would have *assumed* that other team members would do all the work. 
And you know what happens when you *assume* things?

Think about what would've been a better option, and learn more about Somebody, Anybody, and Everybody in our next installment!

THANKS FOR PLAYING! :)
