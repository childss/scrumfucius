Great! Now let's get started. First a little retrospective.
This is where we review what went right or wrong in the last project,
and what we can do better in our next one.
As Somebody, what do you think could've been done to prevent the task going undone?

Think about these options, and in the next installment we'll tell you which one's best!

1) Nobody should've listed to me! As the task giver, I'm obviously the team lead. If Nobody disobeys me again, I'll be very mad!

2) All the team tasks should've been visibly displayed, and progress visibly tracked.
That way, all team members would notice there was a task that wasn't getting done.
I could then remind Nobody about his task, or the team could've surfaced any impediments, or tackled the task all together.

3) If the whole team forgot about the task, it couldn't have been that important. What could've been done better was to not stress so much about it. I don't see why Everybody gave me such a hard time about it…

THANKS FOR PLAYING! :)
